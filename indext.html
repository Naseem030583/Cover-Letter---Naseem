                During my PhD at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, I established a strong research foundation focusing on immune regulatory mechanisms, stem cell biology, and nanotechnology applications. My doctoral research began with investigating immune response mechanisms during bone marrow regeneration. In <strong>"Expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2) during radiation-induced damage and regeneration of bone marrow by transplantation in the mouse" (Molecular Biology Reports, 2019)</strong>, this study conducted the first comprehensive study of IRF-1 and IRF-2 transcription factors in bone marrow regeneration processes. This seminal work employed sophisticated methodologies, including cell cycle analysis, colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays, bone marrow histology, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). This study demonstrated that radiation induced damage followed by bone marrow transplantation resulted in significant regeneration. Through meticulous molecular analysis, this study showed that IRF-1 and IRF-2 were expressed at significantly elevated levels in irradiated bone marrow cells compared to controls. Immunofluorescence analysis and protein expression studies, this study proved that IRF-1 and IRF-2 are sensitive and responsive to radiation-induced damage and play crucial roles in bone marrow regeneration. This work established the fundamental importance of interferon regulatory factors in tissue repair mechanisms, laying the groundwork for understanding immune-mediated regenerative responses.

                My doctoral work culminated in sophisticated mesenchymal stem cell biology studies, specifically investigating interferon regulatory factor expression patterns. This research, later published as <strong>"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the mouse bone marrow show differential expression of interferon regulatory factors IRF-1 and IRF-2" (Molecular Biology Reports, 2024)</strong>, demonstrated the evolution and continuity of my IRF research. This study showed that bone marrow cells (BMCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit distinct expression patterns of IRF-1 and IRF-2. Higher levels of IRF-1 mRNA were consistently observed in both BMCs and MSCs compared to IRF-2. Importantly, this study discovered differential subcellular localization patterns: IRF-1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, while IRF-2 was localized in the nuclei of BMCs. MSCs showed nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of IRF-1 and nuclear localization of IRF-2. The research revealed that MSCs show constitutive expression of pluripotency associated factors Oct3/4 and Sox-2 and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induced prominent cellular localization of IRF-1 and IRF-2. These findings suggest that IRF-1 and IRF-2 regulate immune-responsive properties of BMCs and MSCs through IRF-1, IRF-2-dependent gene expression, and protein-protein interactions, providing crucial insights for immunomodulatory functions of MSCs in cell therapy and regenerative medicine.

                My interdisciplinary approach during my PhD led to a groundbreaking discovery published in <strong>"Self-Assembly of Artificial Sweetener Aspartame Yields Amyloid-like Cytotoxic Nanostructures" (ACS Nano, 2019)</strong>. This pioneering research revealed the intrinsic propensity of aspartame, a universally consumed artificial sweetener, to undergo spontaneous self-assembly and form cytotoxic nanofibrils resembling amyloid structures. The study employed advanced characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, spectroscopic analyses, and sophisticated molecular modeling approaches. Most significantly, this study demonstrated that under physiological conditions, aspartame molecules spontaneously self assemble into regular β-sheet-like cytotoxic nanofibrils of amyloid nature. These nanostructures were found to trigger amyloid cross-seeding and become toxic aggregation traps for globular proteins, Aβ peptides, and aromatic metabolites that convert native structures to β-sheet-like fibrils. The research revealed that aspartame fibrils induce hemolysis, cause DNA damage, and trigger apoptosis and necrosis-mediated cell death. Through detailed biochemical analyses, this study showed that specific spatial arrangement between aspartame molecules is critical for forming stable amyloid-like architecture with a sticky exterior capable of promoting viable H-bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic contacts with biomolecules. This discovery has profound implications for understanding the potential health consequences of widely consumed artificial sweeteners and significantly contributes to nanotoxicology research.

                My postdoctoral career at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio has been marked by significant expansion into cutting-edge areas of calcium signaling, regenerative medicine, immunology, and complex disease mechanisms. This phase has resulted in multiple high-impact publications demonstrating methodological innovations and groundbreaking discoveries. My most significant postdoctoral contribution came through <strong>"Differential activation of Ca²⁺ influx channels modulate stem cell potency, their proliferation/viability and tissue regeneration" (npj Regenerative Medicine, 2021)</strong>. This breakthrough research demonstrated that store-dependent Ca²⁺ entry is essential for modulating bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function and represents a paradigm shift in understanding stem cell therapeutics. This comprehensive study employed sophisticated experimental approaches, including gene silencing techniques, Ca²⁺ channel characterization, multi-parameter flow cytometry, cell cycle analysis, and functional regenerative assays. This study demonstrated that stem cells possess indefinite self-renewable capability, but factors modulating their pluripotency and function were not fully understood. Through meticulous Ca²⁺ channel characterization using gene silencing approaches, this study revealed two distinct Ca²⁺ entry channels operating through Orai1/TRPC1 or via Orai3 pathways that differentially regulate stem cell proliferation and viability. The research showed that increasing external Ca²⁺ modulated cell cycle progression critical for MSC survival and that Ca²⁺ was essential for stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining stem cell potential. Most importantly, this study demonstrated that radiation-induced tissue damage could be effectively mitigated through Ca²⁺ channel modulation. Radiation exposure led to decreased saliva secretion, reduced acinar cell numbers, and enlarged ducts - pathological changes restored by stem cell transplantation propagated in higher Ca²⁺ environments. The study revealed that radiation caused decreased TRPC1 expression and reduced AQP5 levels, both restored upon MSC transplantation. This work proved that Ca²⁺ entry is essential for stem cell function and critical for regenerative medicine applications, establishing a new therapeutic paradigm for tissue repair.

                In <strong>"Increasing cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels restore cell proliferation and stem cell potency in aged MSCs" (Stem Cell Research, 2021)</strong>, this study addressed one of the most challenging problems in regenerative medicine: age-related stem cell dysfunction. This research demonstrated that strategically manipulating intracellular calcium levels could restore proliferative capacity and stemness in aged mesenchymal stem cells. This study showed that aging represents an inescapable, complex physiological process affecting all cells, including stem cells, leading to reduced tissue repair capacity. However, my research revealed that stem cell survival and proliferation of aged MSCs depended on cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels. Through systematic experimentation, this study demonstrated that higher external Ca²⁺ concentrations could reverse age-related functional decline. Ca²⁺ entry potentiated cell cycle progression, and stem cells incubated with higher external Ca²⁺ showed significantly increased cell survival and proliferation. Notably, blocking Ca²⁺ entry using SKF 96365 decreased stem cell survival and proliferation, but treatment with 2-APB did not significantly affect either, indicating specific calcium channel involvement. The research showed that evaluating Ca²⁺ entry channels revealed that TRPC1/Orai1/Orai3 and their regulator STIM1 were essential for MSC proliferation/viability. Gene silencing of Orai1/Orai3/TRPC1/STIM1 significantly inhibited stem cell viability. These findings have profound implications for developing therapeutic strategies to combat age-related degenerative diseases and significantly advance understanding of aging mechanisms.

                My research expertise has expanded to include complex disease pathogenesis, as demonstrated in <strong>"The chemokine receptor CXCR3 promotes CD8⁺ T cell-dependent lung pathology during influenza pathogenesis" (Science Advances, 2024)</strong>. This sophisticated study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, advanced flow cytometry, and cutting-edge immunological techniques to investigate immune responses during viral infection. The research revealed that CD8⁺ T cells play dual roles in influenza control and lung pathology, with protective and pathological functions linked to specific subsets. Through comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis, this study discovered that Cxcr3⁺ CD8⁺ T effector cell enrichment was associated with more robust cytotoxic responses. However, both CD8⁺ T effector and central memory cells exhibited equally potent effector potential. The study identified unique regulons regulating cytotoxic responses in CD8⁺ T cells and showed that late-stage CD8⁺ T blockade in influenza cleared lungs continuously mitigated lung injury without affecting viral clearance. Furthermore, adaptive transfer of wild-type CD8⁺ T cells exacerbated influenza lung pathology in Cxcr3⁻/⁻ mice, proving that CXCR3 interception could have therapeutic effects in preventing influenza-linked lung injury. This research scope has expanded to include vaccine development through <strong>"The vaccine dosing effect overcomes the reduced immunogenic potential and in vivo efficacy of 33F pneumococcal serotype" (Vaccine, 2025)</strong>. This study demonstrated that serotype 33F, an emerging Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype, exhibits reduced immunogenicity, which correlates with reduced protection against pneumonia infection.
